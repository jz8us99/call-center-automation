# Quick Fix for ChunkLoadError

The ChunkLoadError indicates the development server needs to be restarted to load the new code properly.

## Step 1: Restart Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Step 2: Clear Build Cache (if restart doesn't work)

```bash
# Delete build cache
rm -rf .next
# or on Windows:
rmdir /s .next

# Then restart server
npm run dev
```

## Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or open DevTools → Network tab → check "Disable cache"

## Step 4: Test the Products Tab

After restarting:
1. Go to configuration page
2. Click Products tab
3. Should load without errors

## Alternative: Use Simpler Icon Temporarily

If you're still getting icon errors after restart, the issue might be with icon imports. I've created a version that uses inline SVG instead of imported icons.

## Expected Result

After restart, the Products tab should:
✅ Load without ChunkLoadError
✅ Display "Step 2: Products" 
✅ Show business type information
✅ Allow adding product categories and products

## If Still Having Issues

1. Check if all required files exist:
   - `src/components/configuration/BusinessProducts.tsx`
   - `src/app/api/business-products/route.ts`
   - `src/app/api/product-categories/route.ts`

2. Check console for any other errors

3. Verify database setup (run the SQL scripts if not done yet)

The ChunkLoadError is typically resolved by restarting the development server, as it's a module loading issue rather than a code error.
