# Agent Type Scoping Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of agent type scoping tied to business information and user profiles, as requested. The system now ensures that when a user selects an agent type, the configuration is properly scoped to their business type and user account.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Configuration Flow
- **Business Information First**: Users must complete business information before configuring AI agents
- **Dynamic Titles**: Card titles now show "Create new [Agent Type]" dynamically based on selection
- **Business Type Integration**: Agent configuration is tied to the selected business type from business information

### 2. Updated UI Components

#### AgentConfigurationDashboard.tsx
- Added business information section as the first step
- Updated navigation to include "Business Info" step
- Modified titles to be dynamic based on selected agent type
- Added business type context to descriptions
- Implemented proper flow control between sections

#### BusinessInformationHeader.tsx  
- Integrated with database-driven business types
- Added real API integration for saving/loading business profiles
- Dynamic business type selection with icons
- Proper validation and error handling

#### AgentTypeSelector.tsx
- Enhanced to show business type context in header
- Template preview functionality tied to business type
- Loading states for template data
- Business-specific messaging and guidance

### 3. New API Endpoints

#### `/api/business-profile` (GET/POST/PUT)
- Manage client/business profile information
- Scoped to authenticated users
- Maps UI data to database schema
- Supports create and update operations

#### Enhanced Existing APIs
- `/api/business-types` - Returns all business types with icons
- `/api/agent-types` - Returns available agent types for mapping
- `/api/agent-templates` - Template loading based on business + agent type
- `/api/agent-configurations` - Scoped configuration persistence

### 4. Database Integration
- Business profiles stored in `clients` table
- Configuration scoped by `client_id + agent_type_id`
- Template mapping via `business_type_agent_template_map`
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

### 5. Configuration Flow

```
1. User accesses /configuration
2. Business Information section (required first)
   - Select business type
   - Enter business details
   - Save to database (creates client record)
3. Agent Type Selection
   - Shows context: "Configuring: AI Agent for [Business Name] ([Business Type])"
   - Template preview available for each agent type
   - Templates loaded based on business type + agent type combination
4. Configuration Sections
   - Call Scripts (with business-specific templates)
   - Voice Settings (optimized for business type)
   - Call Routing (business-specific rules)
5. Save Configuration
   - Scoped to client_id + agent_type_id
   - Prevents overwrites between different agent types
   - Maintains separation between different businesses
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Business profile state shared across components
- Proper lifecycle management with useEffect hooks  
- Validation of required business information before proceeding

### Data Scoping
```typescript
// Configuration is scoped by:
{
  client_id: businessProfile.id,  // From clients table
  agent_type_id: agentType.id,    // From agent_types table
  // Configuration data specific to this combination
}
```

### Template Loading
```typescript
// Templates loaded based on business + agent type:
GET /api/agent-templates?business_type_id=${businessTypeId}&agent_type_id=${agentTypeId}
```

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing templates
- Validation of required business information
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for async operations

## User Experience Flow

### Title Updates
- **Initial**: "Create New AI Agent"
- **After Business Info**: "Configure your AI agent for [Business Name] ([Business Type])"
- **After Agent Type Selection**: "Create New [Agent Type Name]"

### Navigation Flow
1. **Business Info**: Required first step, cannot proceed without completion
2. **Agent Type**: Unlocked after business info is complete
3. **Configuration Sections**: Available after agent type selection
4. **Template Preview**: Available for each agent type with business-specific content

### Visual Indicators
- Progress indicators showing completion status
- Business type icons and names throughout the flow
- Template preview with comprehensive details
- Loading states during data fetching

## Database Schema Updates

### Modified Tables
- `clients` - Added support_content field
- Enhanced with proper business type relationships

### New Functionality
- Business type to agent type template mapping
- Scoped configuration storage
- Template preview system

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Flow
1. Visit `http://localhost:3002/configuration`
2. Complete business information section
3. Select different business types and verify templates load
4. Choose agent type and verify title updates
5. Configure agent settings and verify scoping
6. Test switching between agent types without data loss

### API Testing
```bash
# Test business types
curl http://localhost:3002/api/business-types

# Test agent types  
curl http://localhost:3002/api/agent-types

# Test template loading (example IDs)
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/agent-templates?business_type_id=[ID]&agent_type_id=[ID]"
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `src/components/configuration/AgentConfigurationDashboard.tsx`
- `src/components/configuration/BusinessInformationHeader.tsx`
- `src/components/configuration/AgentTypeSelector.tsx`
- `ai-agent-management-schema.sql`

### New Files

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: Apply updated schema with business types and templates
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is configured
3. **API Routes**: All new routes are functional and tested
4. **Dependencies**: No new packages required

## Future Enhancements

1. **Template Management**: Admin interface for creating/editing templates
2. **Business Type Analytics**: Track usage by business type
3. **Advanced Scoping**: Multi-location businesses with separate configurations
4. **Template Marketplace**: Sharing templates between businesses
5. **Configuration Versioning**: Track changes to agent configurations

## Summary

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements:

✅ **Business Type Integration**: Agent configuration tied to business information  
✅ **Dynamic Titles**: "Create new [Agent Type]" based on selection  
✅ **Proper Scoping**: Configuration scoped to business + agent type + user  
✅ **Template System**: Business-specific templates for each agent type  
✅ **Complete Flow**: End-to-end user experience from business info to agent config  

The system now provides a comprehensive, business-aware AI agent configuration experience that scales with different business types and maintains proper data isolation.
